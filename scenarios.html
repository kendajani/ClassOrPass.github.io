  <h2>Scenario 1:</h2>

  <p>John Armstead is a professor at the University of Victoria. He is teaching a first-year course in human computer interaction
    for the first time in his career. John is incredibly passionate about this topic and cannot wait to teach this topic and show
    students the wonders of human computer interaction. On the first day, Dr. Armstead’s class is a full house, not an empty seat
    in the lecture hall. He passionately gives his opening lecture and goes home very satisfied. However, as the days go on, more
    and more students drop his course until what started out as a class of 150 students, is now left with only 60 students.
    After the semester is over, John is shocked and deeply saddened he couldn’t show the wonders of human computer interaction to
    his students. Although deeply depressed, John does not give up as he looks for ways he can do better next semester.
    He overhears his colleagues talking about a new class review website called ClassOrPass. He decides to search up his class
    to see what people were saying about the course, what they like, what they don’t like, and shape the course to be a more enjoyable
    experience for everyone. He finds the most upvoted reviews regarding his course on human computer interaction. He finds out that
    most students loved his enthusiasm and passion for the course, but was bogged down by all the labs, homework, and projects to truly
    enjoy his course. He makes the proper adjustments to his course and tries again the following semester.
    Fast-forward a year and John has one of the most popular computer science course in all of UVIC. He credits his success to ClassOrPass.</p>

    <h2>Scenario 2:</h2>

    <p>Jamal Adams is a second-year computer science student at the University of Victoria. Jamal is currently setting up his courses
      for the upcoming semester. He knows what core courses to take to stay on stream, but he needs one more elective to fill out his
      schedule. Jamal is already in 5 fairly demanding courses, all with labs. He decides he wants to take an easy French elective to
      get one of the electives he needs to get done out of the way, as well as start chipping away at that French minor he is looking
      to pursue. He decides to go on ClassOrPass to look up French courses and sorts them by difficulty. He finds FRAN 220 French Phonetics.
      He reads the reviews claiming it is an easy A. He signs up for the course with no hesitation. After receiving his A+ in the course at the end of the semester,
      Jamal returns to ClassOrPass and leaves an upvote on the reviews that encouraged him to take the course.</p>

    <h2>Scenario 3:</h2>

    <p>Poppy is a first-year English student at the University of Victoria. Poppy is what some might call “computer challenged” and has never been too great with them.
      Excited about her new life as a university student, she settles down into her first class.
      The teacher hands out the course outline and starts going over what will be covered in the upcoming semester.
      As the teacher is going over the course outline, Poppy decides to read ahead, only to find an array of essays, presentations,
      reports and a project due within the next month. She assumes there must be some mistake and decides not to drop the course.
      Only to her dismay, all of those things listed in the course outline were indeed due. She goes through the course and ends up with a 52% and is extremely unhappy with the execution of the course. She decides she wants to vent her anger and heard from her friends that the ClassOrPass website would be perfect for her needs. Feeling wary about being able to find the right place to write her review, she searches for ClassOrPass. To her surprise, she is met with a very simple and intuitive layout, in which she finds the course she was looking for within seconds and starts letting out her anger into her review.
      Feeling a sense of justice, she leaves the site satisfied.</p>
