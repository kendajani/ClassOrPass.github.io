<h2>Key Stakeholders</h2>


<div class="words">
    <h3>Students:</h3>

    <p>ClassOrPass will allow students to see an in-depth and personal description of the classes they are
      thinking of taking that is often missed in the UVIC provided course descriptions.
      This will give students more heads up on what to expect from the course instead of going in blind.</p>

    <h3>Teachers:</h3>

    <p>Since the reviews will be written by students, teachers can get the full unfiltered opinions of
      students who have taken their course and felt the need to express their displeasure or excitement for their course.
      This allows the teacher to get a true assessment of how students found their course that is often missed in the course surveys that are taken currently.</p><br>

    <h2>Personas</h2>

    <h3>Persona 1:</h3>

    <p>The first user profile is Dr. John Armstead, a professor teaching varying computer science courses at
      the University of Victoria. Dr. Armstead is originally from interior B.C. and
      moved to Victoria when he was in highschool.
      Dr. Armstead married his highschool girlfriend at the age of 27, then got his Masters and PhD by age 33.
      Dr. Armstead is now a passionate teacher who takes pride in shaping his courses to be as interesting and
      engaging as possible. Dr. Armstead was a student at UVic and was constantly disappointed by his professors.
      Their style of teaching was dry and boring. He always hated going to their classes.
      When Dr. Armstead became a professor at UVic, he vowed that he would do his
      best to keep his classes engaging and make his students happy.
      Dr. Armstead’s biggest struggle currently is finding out the honest opinions
      from his students about how they feel about the course and how it's structured.
      He does not trust the CES that is conducted by the school and is looking elsewhere for information.</p>

    <h3>Persona 2:</h3>

    <p>The second user profile is Jamal Adams, a second-year computer science student at the University of Victoria.
      Jamal moved from Calgary to Victoria to attend university. Jamal lives with multiple roommates,
      all of whom are also in computer science. Jamal’s father is a professor at the University of Calgary and
      his biggest piece of advice he gave to his son before leaving to Victoria was to finish his degree as soon as
      he can. Jamal left determined not only to graduate before all his peers, but to get the
      highest grades possible along the way. To do this, he has created a vast network of fellow computer science
      students who he can ask whether certain courses are too difficult to take with a heavy course load or not.
      This network of friends has served him well up until now. However, he realizes he is completely in the dark about courses
      outside of computer science and he has no idea what elective to take next semester considering his heavy upcoming workload.</p>

      <h3>Persona 3:</h3>

      <p>The third user profile is Poppy Merkins, Poppy is a first-year English student at the University of Victoria.
        Poppy is on an exchange program from the UK. Because she is on exchange, all her friends are as unfamiliar
        with UVic and its systems as she is. To make things worse, Poppy has never been too great with computers and
        frequently avoided using them. Because of this, she found the UVIC website an absolute nightmare to navigate and
        couldn’t figure out what courses to take, and what to expect out of her classes. Feeling defeated, she vents to her
        equally computer challenged friends to see if they know anything that can help her.</p>
