<h2>Introduction to ClassOrPass</h2>
<div class="words">
  <p>UVic currently has a system where the user can look at potential courses to take and see a quick summary of what content is going to be covered in the course. Although the current UVic system does its job in informing students of the contents of the course, this system misses key information such as course load, whether the course is project based, and many other small but vital details that can make or break a class for some students. This is where ClassOrPass comes in. ClassOrPass is a web application that takes the guessing out of choosing courses by having clear and honest descriptions of what the class actually entails. The reviews will be written entirely by students whoâ€™ve taken the class to give a description from the most important point of view, the student.</p>
